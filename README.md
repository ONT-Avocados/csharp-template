## csharp smart contract  
This is ontology C# smart contract template collections, you can refer to these templates when developing ontoloy smart contract.

## Content

These templates are divided into different directory structures according to different functions.

- [Utils] 

  the common.cs contain the most commonly used functions base on NEO VM, like

  bytes to string conversion, biginteger to bytes, and so on.

  All the most common tool templates will be placed in this directory

- [math]

  The  Math.cs and SafeMath.cs provide add, subtract, multiply, divide,mod, max, min, average functions in mathematics.

- [API]

  This directory provide ontology smart contract api template, like Contract api, Storage api, Struct example, Map exmaple, Exception handle exmaple, and so on.

   All examples related to interfaces and data types are placed here.

- [Crypto]

  All cryptographic related contract calls are placed here

- [Asset]

  All cryptographic related contract calls are placed here, like  ont, ong.

- [Application]

  some  contracts with realistic application scenarios will be placed here. like bond.cs, it provides offline bond contracts in the form of smart contracts. It will be useful for the investor and invest institute.

  We may also develop a smart contract for the game later.

  If the contract becomes more and more mature, we will divide it separately for a new project.
